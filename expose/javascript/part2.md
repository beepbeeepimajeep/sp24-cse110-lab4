1. the console will print the value of the variable i,3, which is the number of items in the prices array.
2. the console will print 150, the last assigned value of discounted price in the function
3. the console will print 150 the value of finalPrice 
4. the function returns an array
5. an error occurs, as no value for variable i is found. This is because the variable was declared with the let keyword which only has scope within the block it is declared. 
6. An error occurs, discountedPrice is not valid as it was declared with the let keyword within the for loop but it is called outside that loop on line 13.
7. 150 is printed out by the console. the finalPrice variable is valid within the same block it is defined in. 
8. this function will return and array. no error is thrown.
9. An error occurs, no value is set for variale i. this is because it is out of scope on line 11 as variable i was declared using the let keyword whose scope is only valid within the for loop.
10. line 12 will print the value of the variable length. 
11. this function will return an array
12. a) student.name;
    b) student['Grad Year'];
    c) student.greeting();
    d) student['Favorite Teacher'].name;
    e) student.courseLoad[0];
13. a)'32',2 is converted to string datatype and concatenated with '3'.
    b) 1 , '3' is converted to a number datatype.
    c) 3, null is converted to 0, a number datatype.
    d) '3null', null is converted to string type.
    e) 4, true is converted to the number 1.
    f) 0, both null and false are converted to the number 0.
    g) '3undefined', undefined is converted to the String datatype.
    h) NaN, undefined is converted to NaN, not a number, when undefined is attempted to be
        converted to a number.
14. a) true, string '2' is converted to a number 2>1 evaluates to true.
    b) false, '2' and '12' are evaluated as strings and compared in lexiographical order.
    c) true, '2' is converted as a number therefore 2==2 is true
    d) false, === performs a strict equality check, number 2 and string '2' are different data types and therefore strict check immediately returns false.
    e) false, true is converted to number 1, 1==2 returns false.
    f) true, any Boolean(x) == true unless x==0. true == true is true.
15. == is an equality check, === is a strict inequality check that immediately compared datatypes and returns true if they are the same data-type otherwise, false.

  console.log(`${property}: ${statistics[property]}`);
